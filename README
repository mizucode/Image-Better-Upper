To deploy to Heroku:

Install Heroku CLI

set up virtual environment:

cd into folder where app is located (ex. downloads, pycharmprojects)

% virtualenv app-name

% source app-name/bin/activate

*Make sure your requirements.txt folder matches your venv installs

% cd app-name

% pip3 install flask gunicorn



 add wsgi.py file

 in wsgi.py, add the following:
    from app.app import app

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()


% python wsgi.py

if missing modules errors, install them via pip or relevant installer
ex. missing module imageio
in cli, % pip3 install imageio

if import error, try re-installing package associated with it (in my case it was numpy) in pycharm or ide you are using

run % python wsgi.py another time

go to running url specified

if any other errors, check back to terminal, mine were fairly obviously stated,
 such as could not find in 'app/static', did you mean 'static' instead?
(run python wsgi.py until no errors)

Press CTRL+C to quit

% pip3 freeze

% pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

Add Procfile (type text file) to image-better-upper folder

Add to Procfile:
    web: gunicorn wsgi:app

Log in to Heroku and create app

% heroku login

% git init

% heroku git:remote -a name-of-your-heroku-app

% git add .

% git commit -am "First heroku deploy"

% git push heroku HEAD:master
